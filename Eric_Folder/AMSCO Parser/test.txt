1953 title and of the two axes of a given chart or graph will help you understand the information. However, some data-based questions are actually cause-and-effect and chronology questions, such as the following graph question:
Which of the following best accounts for the curve on the graph above depicting immigration to the United States from Asia, Africa, and the Americas between 1882 and 1900?

You would need to know something about the immigration restrictions placed on Asians starting in 1882 to answer this question correctly. 6. Chronology or "when" questions rarely require students to know a specific date, but rather the proper order of events. For example, the AP exam might test whether you know that the Declaration of Independence preceded the writing of the U.S. Constitution. Often, chronology questions ask which event occurred first or last, or in what presidential administration something happened. 7. The AP exam also expects some level of visual literacy. The multiple-choice exam will include a few examples of political cartoons, photographs, or artwork. The information provided in the visual will offer clues to the answer, but your ability to place the cartoon or photograph in the context of a particular era will help. 8. The AP History exam gives you 55 minutes to answer the 80 questions. Most students can answer two multiple-choice questions a minute. It is more sensible to follow a relaxed but reasonable pace than to rush through the exam and then go back and try to second-guess your decisions. However, 55 minutes does not allow enough time to spend two or three minutes on difficult questions. You need to mark them in your booklet (not on the answer sheet) and return to them after finishing the exam. Be careful when skipping questions and in making erasures. Recommended Activity. Practicing sample multiple-choice questions is important before the exam, if for no reason than to reduce the number of surprises over the format of the questions. For most students, however, the review of content through multiple-choice questions is not the most efficient and useful way to prepare for the exam. It is the purpose of the chapter narrative in this text to provide a useful and meaningful review of the essential content of U.S. history. By reviewing essential facts in their historical content, you will better recall and understand the connections between events--so important for an analytical understanding of history.

EXPLORATION, DISCOVERY, AND SETTLEMENT, 1492­1700
Thus out of small beginnings greater things have been produced by His hand that made all things of nothing, and gives being to all things that are; and, as one small candle may light a thousand, so the light here kindled hath shone unto many, yea in some sort to our whole nation.
William Bradford, Of Plymouth Plantation--1620­1647

The original exploration, discovery, and settlement of North and South

America occurred thousands of years before Christopher Columbus was born. In fact, many archeologists now believe that the first people to settle North America arrived as much as 40,000 years ago. At that time, waves of migrants from Asia may have crossed a land bridge that then connected Siberia and Alaska (a bridge now submerged under the Bering Sea). Over a long period of time, successive generations migrated southward from the Arctic Circle to the south
